# Bryce's React UI Library
My custom UI component library for React for both Javascript and Typescript! This library uses a lot of guidance from the [https://react.zeit-ui.co/en-us/guide/introduction](Zeit UI Library for React)

## Why am I creating this library?
If you have been developing frontend for a long time or even for a company or 2, you may have realized the annoyance of recreating the wheel when it came to your frontend development. How many times have you created a component that was almost identical to another one you made in another project? This is where a component library really helps you! Creating resuable components that can be downloaded like a package is very useful!

## How is this being hosted?
I am hosting this on my Github. This means that if you want to download it, you must use the Github registry instead of the NPM registry which can be done like so:

```
yarn add --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ @bdevo1896/react
```

This way it is easy for to know where to pull it from and I'm not trying to have this seen too much by the public yet until I make it much more useful and extendable!
